Cement is a mod loader built for Gang Beasts using BepInEx, written in the C# Language.

The mod loader automatically downloads files needed for mods to work and loades them into the game.

It is possible to create anything using Cement as a base.

There are also a handful of helpful Modules, that can be installed additionally to Cement, which add useful features, making it easier for creators to make mods.

Cement is what holds your mods together.
